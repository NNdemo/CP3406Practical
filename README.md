Scenario 6: Student Study and Time Management App
Lisa is a busy college student balancing her academic responsibilities, part-time job, and social life.
She often finds herself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks, assignments, and deadlines,
making it difficult to stay organized and focused. Despite her best efforts, she often misses deadlines
and struggles to prioritize whatâ€™s most important. Lisa feels that she needs a better way to manage
her time, set specific goals, and track her progress toward achieving both academic and personal
milestones. She wants an app that helps her break down her tasks, set clear study goals, and prioritize
her daily activities. The app should help Lisa visualize her workload, track her progress, and ensure
she maintains a healthy balance between studying, working, and enjoying her social life. -->
